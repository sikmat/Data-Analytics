# WEEK 1 
Data Analytics
Responsibilities and Roles:
- Data collection and preparation
- Data analysis
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Decision support
- Collaboration and communication
- Continous learning and adaptation
This helps an organization make informed decisions and improve operations, drive strategies and create competitive advantage.
Must understand how to aqcuire, clean and transform data to meet organization's needs.
Create powerful visualizations to display the collected and analyzed data to decision-makers, stakeholders.

Analytics is made possible by modern data, storage and computing capabilities, the three pillars.
- There is a huge amount of data in the world.
- The cost of storage has dropped drastically over time, making storage easily available/affordable
- Continous advancement in computing power has benefited analytics. Supercomputers needed for analytics use to be expensive and a scarce resource. Now there is enough computing power on a single laptop to perform analytics tasks.
These three trends—the massive volume of data generated by our businesses on a daily basis, the availability of inexpensive storage to retain that data, and the cloud's promise of virtually infinite computing power—come together to create fertile ground for data analytics.

Analytics Process
1. Data Acquisition
2. Cleaning and manipulation
3. Analysis
4. Visualization
5. Reporting and Communication
- The process is iterative, a set of interrelated actions that may be revisited frequently while working with a dataset. Like noticing unusual data points in a dataset and having to go back to cleaning the data and rerun analysis with the newly cleaned data, and having to return to data acqusition stage as well.

Analysis Techniques
1. Descriptive
2. Predictive
3. Prescriptive
