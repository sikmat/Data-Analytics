# DATA ANALYTICS

# WEEK 1 
Data Analytics
Responsibilities and Roles:
- Data collection and preparation
- Data analysis
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Decision support
- Collaboration and communication
- Continous learning and adaptation
This helps an organization make informed decisions and improve operations, drive strategies and create competitive advantage.
Must understand how to aqcuire, clean and transform data to meet organization's needs.
Create powerful visualizations to display the collected and analyzed data to decision-makers, stakeholders.

Analytics is made possible by modern data, storage and computing capabilities, the three pillars.
- There is a huge amount of data in the world.
- The cost of storage has dropped drastically over time, making storage easily available/affordable
- Continous advancement in computing power has benefited analytics. Supercomputers needed for analytics use to be expensive and a scarce resource. Now there is enough computing power on a single laptop to perform analytics tasks.
These three trends—the massive volume of data generated by our businesses on a daily basis, the availability of inexpensive storage to retain that data, and the cloud's promise of virtually infinite computing power—come together to create fertile ground for data analytics.

Analytics Process
1. Data Acquisition
2. Cleaning and manipulation
3. Analysis
4. Visualization
5. Reporting and Communication
- The process is iterative, a set of interrelated actions that may be revisited frequently while working with a dataset. Like noticing unusual data points in a dataset and having to go back to cleaning the data and rerun analysis with the newly cleaned data, and having to return to data acqusition stage as well.

Analysis Techniques
1. Descriptive
2. Predictive
3. Prescriptive

ML, AI and Deep Learning

Machine Learning: Uses algorithms to discover knowledge in datasets that can be applied to make informed decisions about the future. Useful in the following:

- Segmenting customers and determining the marketing messages that will appeal to different customer groups.
- Discovering anomalies in system and application logs that may be indicative of a cybersecurity incident.
- Forecasting product sales based on market and environmental conditions.
- Recommending the next movie that a customer might wish to watch based on their past activity and the preferences of similar customers.
- Setting prices for hotel rooms far in advance based on forecasted demand

Artificial Intelligence: Techniques used to get a computer to imitate human behavior, to try and behave as if they are intelligent.

Machine Learning: Is also a subset of AI techniques, attempting to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge. It is AI techniques designed to learn.

Deep Learning: Is a further subdivision of ML that uses complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way. It is a highly specialized field of ML, mostly used for image, video and sound analysis

Data Governance
Ensures that an organization has high-quality data and is able to effectively control that data. Using Master Data Management programs to maintain and improve the quality of the data.

Analytics Tool: Automate much of the heavy workload of analysis, improving the analyst's ability to acquire, clean, manipulate, visualizer and analyze data. As well as assistance in reporting and communicating results. Examples of these tools are Excel spreadsheet, Google sheets.
